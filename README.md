 NHL Player Performance Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a **machine learning-based projection system** that predicts how a hockey player will perform in their **first three NHL seasons** based on their **pre-NHL statistics**. The model processes **historical player data**, scrapes additional statistics from **HockeyDB**, and applies **Random Forest Regression** to generate performance forecasts.

## Why This Project Matters
Unlike the NFL or NBA, where players primarily come from the **NCAA**, NHL players come from **various leagues worldwide** (AHL, KHL, SHL, OHL, NCAA, etc.), making performance comparisons difficult.  
Our model accounts for **league difficulty and player development paths** to make **accurate NHL projections**.

## What Makes Our Model Unique?

- **Adjusts for League Difficulty** – Accounts for variations in scoring difficulty across different leagues.  
- **Incorporates Global Data** – Analyzes stats from players across **all major pre-NHL leagues**.  
- **Built by Hockey Players, for Hockey Players** – As UCSB hockey players, we understand player development beyond just numbers.

## Project Steps

### **1️. Data Collection & Processing**
- Extracted **NHL player stats** from an original dataset and filtered relevant player information.  
- Scraped **additional player career stats** from **HockeyDB** for a more complete dataset.

### **2️. Data Cleaning & Standardization**
- Removed **unnecessary data** and duplicates.  
- Eliminated **unqualified players** (those with less than three NHL seasons) to ensure unbiased predictions.  
- Structured the dataset to include **pre-NHL and NHL career stats**.

### **3️. Machine Learning Model**
Built a **Random Forest Regression model** to predict:  
- **Games Played (GP)**  
- **Goals (G)**  
- **Assists (A)**  
- **Points (PTS)**  
- **Penalty Minutes (PIM)**  
- **Plus/Minus (+/-)**  

Our model outperformed **Multiple Linear Regression**, as **Random Forest captures non-linear trends and league differences** more effectively.
Resulting **MAE(Mean Absolute Error) of 1.03** meaning we were able to accurately predict player NHL production by a little more than 1 point.

### **4️. Developing an Interactive Website**
- A **Flask-based web platform** is in development to allow users to input player data and get NHL performance predictions.
- Features include:  
  - **Player Analysis & Projections** – View projected NHL performance.  
  - **League Difficulty Comparison** – Analyze performance trends across leagues.  
  - **Player Comparison** – Compare predictions with actual NHL players.
